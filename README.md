Phets

Hello, this is the Wiz Robotics Phet Repo!

This is where you will be uploading your phets to the repo. 

Notice: phet should not be structured into folders, as that messes up the imports and interaction with different phet files. 
Example: You are unable to grunt, since "chipper" does not have access to the other relevant files needed to compile. 


Introduction to phet: You should read the phet docs on the phet github. The link is https://github.com/phetsims/phet-info/tree/master/doc .
You will mostly want to focus on *software design patterns* , and *phet development overview*

When you upload your phets on the github, make sure to create a new branch so that people interested in cloning are able to compile, modify, and experiment with your phet. 

1. The steps to create a new branch would be. <br> 
```git checkout -b <new branch name goes here>```<br>

2. Then you could add the files and commit them towards the branch. <br>
```git add .``` <br> 
``` git commit -m 'message goes here'```<br>

3. Then push <br>
```git push```
