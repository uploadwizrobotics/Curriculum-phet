Phets

Hello, this is the Wiz Robotics Phet Repo!

This is where you will be uploading your phets to the repo. 

Notice: phet should not be structured into folders, as that messes up the imports and interaction with different phet files. 
Example: You are unable to grunt, since "chipper" does not have access to the other relevant files needed to compile. 

When you upload your phets on the github, make sure to create a new branch so that people interested in cloning are able to compile, modify, and experiment with your phet. 

1. The steps to create a new branch would be. <br> 
```git checkout -b <new branch name goes here>```<br>

2. Then you could add the files and commit them towards the branch. <br>
```git add .``` <br> 
``` git commit -m 'message goes here'```<br>

3. Then push <br>
```git push```
